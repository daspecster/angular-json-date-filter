Description:
First community credit union in breach of contract, I had 3 loans never late or missing any payments. 2 loans where paid off, the 3rd loan I paid 400.00 a month, my loan agreement was to pay 344,00 a month. May 2021 I paid 1,000, every other payment up until August was paid, in August I called to defer the payment, agent informed they would put it on the end of the loan also I was 3 payments ahead. I asked to proceed with the deferred payment. September 9 2021 I paid 700.00 with check in person. Payment was not posted until October according to my credit report, I was contacted by agent saying I had 24 hours to make a payment I could not log into the on line account. or they would be repossessing my property, next night a tow company threw me to the ground as I protested him not to come on my property. Fccu would not let me know how to get my property back, I went to the corporate office asking the same question about the payments I made and where my vehicle was located, he refused to provide me with that information also would not look at my account or my contact. Next day I go to the local credit union asking to see my account information, I had payment ready in full, she would not allow me access to any information. Could not tell me the exact location of my truck or if I would be able to get it that day, she then told me the amount was 2,000 more than my loan was in May, she said she was off work and I had to leave she wasnâ€™t doing anything for me, she called the police and I left. Never recovering my truck or money
